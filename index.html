My Dearest Tomoka,
I never thought id ever cry on exchange, let alone cry over a girl I love so much and that too in front of her.  You’ve really seen all of me, my vulnerable side - sad, happy, confused, frustrated, excited, sick (thanks for being my medicine) and of course how can I forget, the sexy time side;). And throughout it all I felt at home, you really are where I feel safe and comfortable, I mean quite literally in the last week (thank you so so much for letting me stay at yours). I didn’t know I was capable of genuinely loving someone so much. This last month has felt magical, my heart has grown so much I really feel like it might explode at any moment now, and I cant handle all the love you give me. Im sorry if I ever questioned ur love, I guess its because I never thought someone would show so much affection and care so much about me, I never really grew up in a place that showed or told me they loved me, so honestly it just surprises me sometimes.

And as I sit here writing this while Im on my flight that seperates us and challenges us to a new chapter I want you to know that you taught me how to love, what it means to love, how love feels, and I will do whatever I can to fight for our love. There might be many bumps on the way but baby just like how I kept on falling and falling in snowboarding, I’ll always get back up and try harder again each time until it works and feels effortless - even if my ass gets fucked (pegging hehe?) I think loving you is the sweetest gift ive received in my life, the warmth I get when cuddling you is unlike any other, I feel like I can melt in your arms while listening to the sweet lullaby of your heartbeat.

When I look into your eyes, I really do see a future of us together, and when we’re yapping and I make you laugh its like the most addicting drug in the world, you have the cutest smile and I never want to see it go away and - And im gonna miss seeing that in person so fucking much and I cant wait to be in your arms again. Baby im really gonna miss cooking together, I really feel like you’re my wifey, I love being your assistant and I love how you can take charge and lead, im gonna miss cutting everything on the chopping board for you so much. We’ve made so many fire meals together, even in the worst kitchen in the world (sorry I couldn’t fix tsh kitchen) - but I really do think we make an incredible team, I feel confident when im with you and I feel like we can solve any challenge the world throws at us (can’t believe we handled every challenge in the ski trip and didn’t die).

And I think long dist is just another big challenge that we’ll get over, like we always do. You’ve made me change so much for the better, I never thought id leave exchange liking rice (wtfff???). I really owe you big for changing that, you’re going to make meal prep and bulk so much easier and I cant wait to try all the Japanese dishes you like which have rice. And omg sleep?? - I learnt to sacrifice sleep, I never thought id ever sleep at 730am, crazyyyy. I never thought id try so many different foods and I love trying new things with you (thanks for teaching me chopsticks im really going to practice a lot).

And baby I want to like the same things as you, I want you to show you the things I like and I always want to understand you more (im really going to try hard to learn Japanese). Drinkingggg!! You got me drinking again and showed that it can be fun again, but hmmm maybe bad influence, my mommy might not like hehe. I never thought I would be calling someone baby soooo much and also kisses and cuddling in public but I love our little kisses, you make me feel like a little kid again and I love it when you call me baby.

If you told me at the start of exchange that this is the person I would be I would have never believed you in a million years, but I guess thats what love does to you. I just wish I met you sooner and I didn’t have to wait to meet you again, I have so many things I want to do with you, baby please come back soon. And omggg baby I cant believe we never finished a movie together, I guess we finally will with long distance, we just needed a really big big big  12000km wall in between us.

So Babygirl, I would rather swim stormy seas with you, then sail calm waters with anyone else, even if I drown - ill die with a smile hehe.

See you soon xoxo, LOVE YOU SOOO SOO FUCKING MUCH
